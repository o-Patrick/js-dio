# Get medics
 Exercise for printing only the name of medics using the map method developed during one class in the "Coleções" (Collections) JavaScript course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/). 

 I highly encourage you to check [stebsnusch's original repository](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/colecoes) for this course!
