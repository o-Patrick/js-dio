# error-handling
 Exercise for printing the array only if no error is detected developed during one class in the "Debugging e Error Handling" (Debugging and Error Handling) JavaScript course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/). 

 I highly encourage you to check [stebsnusch's original repository](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/debug-error) for this course!
