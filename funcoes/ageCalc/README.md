# ageCalc
 Webpage for calculating a person's age developed during one class in the "Funções" (Functions) JavaScript course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/). 

 The result is only shown on the console.

 I highly encourage you to check [stebsnusch's original repository](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/funcoes) for this course!
