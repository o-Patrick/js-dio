# Alumni
 Webpage for checking if a student is approved developed during one class in the "Funções" (Functions) JavaScript course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/). 

 There is a total of five methods to do this verification on [my JS file](https://github.com/o-Patrick/alumni/blob/main/alumni.js). Although only three of them work (2, 3 and 4) I decided to keep the other two just to showcase what was intended to do. 

 I highly encourage you to check [stebsnusch's original repository](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/funcoes) for this course!
