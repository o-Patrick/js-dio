# Count
 Webpage for counting developed during one class in the "Introdução ao JavaScript" (Introduction to JavaScript) course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at DIO (Digital Innovation One).

 The details on the [JS file](https://github.com/o-Patrick/count/blob/main/assets/js/scripts.js) were done by me but following [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch). Also both the [HTML](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/blob/main/introducao-ao-javascript/contador/index.html) and [CSS](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/blob/main/introducao-ao-javascript/contador/assets/styles.css) files were completely done by her and just copied by me.
 
 I highly encourage you to check [her original repository for this course!](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/introducao-ao-javascript)
