# To-do list
 To-do list webpage developed during one class in the "Introdução ao JavaScript" (Introduction to JavaScript) course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at DIO (Digital Innovation One).

 The HTML, CSS and JS files have only a few word changes done by me but were 99% copied from [stebsnusch's originals](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/introducao-ao-javascript/to-do%20list).
 
 I highly encourage you to check [her original repository for this course!](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/introducao-ao-javascript)
