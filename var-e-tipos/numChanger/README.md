 Webpage for changing even numbers that are different than zero developed during one class in the "Vari√°veis e Tipos" (Variables and its Types) JavaScript course tutored by [stebsnusch](https://github.com/stebsnusch) at [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://web.dio.me). 

 I highly encourage you to check [her original repository](https://github.com/stebsnusch/basecamp-javascript/tree/main/variaveis-e-tipos) for this course!
